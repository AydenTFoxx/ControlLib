TODO: Disable MindBlast unconditionally when in a Rain Meadow lobby;
      Alternatively force-disable it on Meadow mode, and set its value to the host's, false by default.
      Alternatively even, add Meadow support for MindBlast. Easier said than done.

TODO: Reduce speed of possessed items and give the player better control of their trajectories. Also give them *some* friction for heavens' sake.
    Work-in-progress; Needs testing.
    Done ig? Mostly fine with the current system, even if it's by no means "perfect".

Possessing the same item twice causes it to be thrown from the player's position, sometimes with an arbitrary offset.

Possessing a spear stuck in a wall/ceiling leaves behind an invisible beam, which can still be climbed by Slugcat.
    Fixed! Finally, the invisible spear is gone for good.

TargetSelector sometimes fails to query for targets, as if the player had just queried beforehand. Reusing TargetCursor multiple times eventually fixes the issue.
    Never replicated this one again, assuming to be fixed or invalid.

PossessionTimer lerps kinda funny when changing screens, swiftly jumping between the last position and the new one.
    *Mostly* fixed by mere lerping shenanigans, which are ironically enough the very cause of this issue.

TODO: Add support for possessing items with TargetSelector, instead of using the Debug class.

// TODO: A mod where Saint's Attunement ability is replaced with a "Revival" ability, akin to Ascended Saint.
//       Karmic Burst is disabled in all modes except Arena (configurable, can also be set to only enable for challenges)
//       Rubicon's challenge rooms are unlocked after a given amount of time without being killed. When the pipes are unlocked, all creatures are pacified, akin to an Echo.
//       Saint now ascends themselves instead of the Void Worm in their ascension ending (toggleable; an easter egg and nod to AscendedSaint)
//       The tutorial for the ascension attack is replaced by a new tutorial for reviving a creature. When triggered while in a shelter, a dead Batfly is spawned on the next room. Otherwise, it spawns at Saint's position.

TODO: (ModLib) Make ModPlugin mode stable at startup and deactivation; Exceptions should be gracefully handled instead of causing undefined behavior.

TODO: Divine Slugcat Blast

TODO: (ModLib) Separate ServerOptions instances and make OptionUtils reference Registry.MyMod to retrieve the correct instance.

TODO: Add "detached" mode for possessed items, where they follow Slugcat around without being explicitly controlled.
      Optionally also allow some cool interactions, like grabbing these objects or commanding them to attack a creature.
